# ğŸ§® Prime and Composite Number Checker (Project 15)

## ğŸ“‹ Description

This Python program helps you determine whether numbers in a given range are **Prime** or **Composite**. It also counts the total number of prime and composite numbers in the range.

## ğŸš€ How It Works

- **Prime numbers**: Numbers greater than 1 that can only be divided by 1 and themselves.
- **Composite numbers**: Numbers that have divisors other than 1 and themselves.

### Example:

```python
Enter starting number: 1
Enter finishing number: 10

1 is neither prime nor composite
2 is prime
3 is prime
4 is composite
...
Count: 4 Prime and 5 Composite numbers in the range.
```

## ğŸ›‘ Error Handling

- Input validation for natural numbers (only positive integers).
- Ensures that the starting number is less than or equal to the ending number.

## ğŸ”§ Requirements
Python 3.x
